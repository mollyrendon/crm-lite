# CRM LITE

## Description

This is a simple CRM meant for use by small businesses and sole proprietors that need a simple app to keep track of customers and potential customers. This information is stored in a backend db and accessed by users assigned to that data by session and authentication. There are many future implementations planned but this is a MVP deployed in 8 days. Implementations include search function, updating, client side messages and UI/UX changes.
